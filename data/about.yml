- milestone: Growing up multicultural
  ms_text: I was born in London by a Swedish mother and a Portuguese father. By the time I was 7, I had lived in 3 countries and learned 3 languages. That set the foundation for the nomad (digital mainly nowadays) I am. <br><strong> I feel comfortable in changing environments</strong>

- milestone: Studies
  ms_text: It wasn't really until I attended university that I became intersted in studying. Before that I had attended primary and secondary education and done obligtory military service, which actually gave me some time to reflect on what I wanted to do, which was to go to university and study international business - that kicked of a passion for life-long learning and I've taken both classifications and courses regularly ever since. <br><strong>I enjoy learning new things</strong>
